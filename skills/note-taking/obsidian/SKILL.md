# Obsidian Vault

**Location:** Set via `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` environment variable (e.g. in `~/.spark/.env`).

If unset, defaults to `~/.spark/workspace/wiki`.

Note: Vault paths may contain spaces - always quote them.

## Read a note

```bash
VAULT="${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH:-$HOME/.spark/workspace/wiki}"
cat "$VAULT/Note Name.md"
```

## List notes

```bash
VAULT="${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH:-$HOME/.spark/workspace/wiki}"

# All notes
find "$VAULT" -name "*.md" -type f

# In a specific folder
ls "$VAULT/Subfolder/"
```

## Search

```bash
VAULT="${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH:-$HOME/.spark/workspace/wiki}"

# By filename
find "$VAULT" -name "*.md" -iname "*keyword*"

# By content
grep -rli "keyword" "$VAULT" --include="*.md"
```

## Create a note

```bash
VAULT="${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH:-$HOME/.spark/workspace/wiki}"
cat > "$VAULT/New Note.md" << 'ENDNOTE'
# Title

Content here.
ENDNOTE
```

## Append to a note

```bash
VAULT="${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH:-$HOME/.spark/workspace/wiki}"
echo "
New content here." >> "$VAULT/Existing Note.md"
```

## Wikilinks

Obsidian links notes with `[[Note Name]]` syntax. When creating notes, use these to link related content.
